#1 is a matrix I use for calling active regions.
#2 is what I use for the differential analysis.
You should easily be able to head each one and get an idea how they are set up.

1) /data/hodges_lab/ATAC-STARR_V2/data/ATAC-STARR_cts_matricies/GM12878inGM12878_counts.tsv

2) /data/hodges_lab/ATAC-STARR_V2/data/ATAC-STARR_cts_matricies/GM12878inGM12878/differential_analysis/GGvsLL_counts_GG-only.tsv
### I think 2) is this: /data/hodges_lab/ATAC-STARR_V2/data/ATAC-STARR_cts_matricies/differential_analysis/GGvsLL_counts_GG-only.tsv

You can take a peak at my scripts if your interested in how each was made. Sorry if they arenâ€™t commented very well.
1) /data/hodges_lab/ATAC-STARR_V2/bin/ATAC-STARR-RE_FG-method_generation/create-counts-matrix.slrm
2) /data/hodges_lab/ATAC-STARR_V2/bin ATAC-STARR-RE_differential-analysis/prep_counts_DESeq2-method.slrm

If you are interested in how the DESeq2 analysis is done, here are those associated scripts:
1) /data/hodges_lab/ATAC-STARR_V2/bin/ATAC-STARR-RE_FG-method_generation/Active-RE-calling_DESeq2.Rmd
2) /data/hodges_lab/ATAC-STARR_V2/bin ATAC-STARR-RE_differential-analysis/prep/ATAC-STARR_Differential-Analysis_DESeq2.Rmd

Let me know if you have any questions/need more clarification and if/when you want the different region files to analyze for enhancer age and complexity.
